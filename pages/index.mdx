## Close Up Dataset

##### Overview

* 10k images
* 100 diverse identities spanning gender, skin tone, and age. 1024 x 1024 RGB images
* Rich set of pixel-perfect labels including segmentation maps, depth, surface normals, and 3D landmarks
* Variation of expressions from neutral to extreme
* Variation in eye gaze over 10°
* Variation of head pose of 30° in all directions
* Many different hairstyles, colors, and facial hair
* Accessories include glasses, headphones, and face masks
* Variation in outfits
* Variation in background over a wide range of lighting and confounding elements

The data can be used to train the following areas:

* Facial segmentation
    * Variation over identities, facial expression, and confounds challenges models segmenting facial regions.
    * Granular subsegmentation maps includes X regions such as "ear_left", "eyelashes", "eyelid", “hair”
* Matting / Background Removal
    * Variation in background, lighting, and hair styles produce mimics hard to segment real-world conditions.
    * Pixel-accurate alpha masks as ground truth
* Landmark Estimation
    * A high variation of camera perspectives and facial expressions enables different perspectives on the face in order to improve the landmark estimation.
    * 2D and 3D anatomical and contour landmarks available.
